Welcome to Pano.js
==================

The aim of this project is to provide a fast and lightweight library that helps to display panorama scene on web pages. Pano.js is based upon Javascript and HTML5 technology. It uses WebGL for very efficient hardware accelerated display. For browsers where WebGL is not available, a canvas 2D rendering backend will be enabled as a fallback.
